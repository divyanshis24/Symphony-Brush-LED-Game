# Introduction
This project was developed during a 6-hour hackathon for our course. Inspired by the popular game Angry Birds, we decided to create a similar game that runs on an OLED screen, utilizing the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 microcontroller.

# Design
Our design takes inspiration from classic arcade games. We aimed to prototype a nostalgic gaming experience, combining modern technology with the charm of old-school arcade games.

# How to Play
The game is controlled using a joystick, which allows the player to adjust the angle of a continuously firing cannon. When the cannon hits a target, a new target appears at a random position on the screen. The speed of the cannon fire can be easily controlled using two touch sensors located on the back of the mini arcade, making it convenient to adjust the speed with a single touch. The objective is to score as many points as possible by hitting the targets. Have fun and enjoy the game!
